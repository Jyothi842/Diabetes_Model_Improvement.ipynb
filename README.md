# Diabetes Classification using Machine Learning

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting diabetes using Machine Learning techniques. The model is trained using the Diabetes dataset and evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix.

This project was developed as part of an AI Internship task to gain practical experience in data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and reporting.

---

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a patient has diabetes based on medical attributes and to improve prediction performance using advanced classification algorithms.

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains medical features such as:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose Level
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age
- Outcome (Target Variable)

The Outcome column indicates:
- 0 → Non-diabetic
- 1 → Diabetic

---

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

---

## Model Used
Random Forest Classifier was used to train the model for diabetes prediction.

---

##  Model Evaluation
The model performance was evaluated using:

- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix

The model achieved an accuracy of approximately **0.76**.
